"""OpenTinker Environment Module.

This module provides the environment framework for LLM training, including:
- BaseEnvironment: Abstract base class for all environments
- GameEnvironment: For multi-turn game environments (Gomoku, etc.)
- StaticDataEnvironment: For single-turn static datasets (Math, etc.)
- Data generators and utilities
